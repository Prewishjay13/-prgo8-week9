        <p id="doc">This webpage uses 2 types of learning. Regression and Classification.<br>
          For the Rice Dataset I used the decision tree classification method and ml classifier.<br>
          Which was really hard to figure out! And for the protein I used ml5 regression.
            </p>
        <br>
        <p>The accuracy of the rice dataset was around 99.6%.</p><br>
        <p>The reason for this is because the rice dataset is very large with over 10k entries</p>
        <p>I cleaned the rice dataset up by rewriting some labels.</p>
        <p>I also had to remove some of the data which might have influenced the accuracy of the model</p>
        <p>The model was really big and had to be reduced in size because the training was taking so long the</p>
        <p>the application started crashing.</p>
        <p>After that I tried using Classification on the dataset of ml5.</p><br>
        <p>Using regression on the protein/nutrition dataset was a no go.</p>
        <p>There were a lot of datapoints missing and the output would not be accurate.</p>
        <p>So i used it on the rice Data set to see if it can predict the roundness of a grain.</p>
        <p>Why? Because I wanted to try to combine to models and output them on the same page.</p><br>
        <p>When it came to using classification with ml 5 that was an absolute nightmare.</p>
        <p>After reusing old code and trying to make it do a classification and failing I used one of my</p><br>
        <p> older code that worked and changed it to work with the dataset. But the Dataset is huge</p>
        <p>the thing ive learned is that decision trees is faster when it comes to classification.</p>
        <p>Ml5 Classification might be great too but it gets slow with big datasets, and cleaning datasets with 10's of thousands of datapoints</p>
        <p>will take more time than just using a .filter method to clean it up.</p>

        <p class="note">Note about the model:<br>
        The decision tree model has an accuracy of 99.6%. This is because of its size.</p>
